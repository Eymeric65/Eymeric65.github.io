After [Installing Poetry](/p/014519b650ae451bb4db75ee90cd7385), CleanRL can be installed.

Begin by running `poetry install` in the directory containing the `pyproject.toml` file.

To utilize CUDA 11.3, it is necessary to [manually update the Poetry installation](https://docs.cleanrl.dev/get-started/basic-usage/#two-ways-to-run):

```bash
poetry run pip install torch==1.12.1 --upgrade --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
```

*Note: This manual installation will be reverted each time `poetry install` is invoked.*
