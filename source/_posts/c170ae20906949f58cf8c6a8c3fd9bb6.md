This tutorial will give the main step through an exemple on how to create a GitHub action script. The structure of a GitHub action script will be described and each core element to automatically deploy a Sphinx documentation on GitHub pages and the package to PyPi (and testPyPi for intermediate release).

## Goal Framework

Before diving into the detail, it is good to recall the global framework that we want to obtain. This bi-function script can be resumed by the following schematic :

The following action need to be executed :

- Build the library to a python executable file (typically a wheel file)
- Build the documentation of the library
  - Deploy the documentation to Github Pages
- Publish the python library to PyPi
  - If the commit is tagged with a release, release to PyPi
    - Sign the package and publish it to github release
  - If the commit is not tagged, check if we push a new version (or if we update docs,...)
    - If it is linked with a new version release it on testPyPi

On the following section, each part of this framework will be described.

## Github Action scripting basic

The way of writing GitHub action can seems at first glance to be really easy but it undercover a lot of possible complexity.
The core of this type of scripting is to allow a really strong modularity and sandboxability between *"jobs"*.
The whole GitHub action script takes place in a *.yml* file. YAML is a human-readable data serialization language, in a way it can be seen as the successor of JSON.

A typical Github action script will be placed in `.github/workflows/` and will contain the following starting clause:

- **name :** for the name of our workflow.

```yaml
name: Publish Python 🐍 distribution 📦 to PyPI and TestPyPI
```

- **on :** litteraly *on* what occasion our script will be launched.

```yaml
on: # Script will trigger each time a push is made to main branch
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```

*The first particularity of YAML can be unvailed here, **a subsection title can become a value** if we want, and everything in YAML need to be thought in this way... for exemple :*

```yaml
on:
  push
```

*will mean that the script will trigger each time we push.*

- **permissions :** sets the permission that we will give to our action.

```
# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
```

- **concurrency :** sets the rule of what happen if we launch a new github action while the last one is already launched (overkill for our example framework)

```
concurrency:
  group: "publish"
  cancel-in-progress: false
```

## Basic GitHub action Job

This tutorial won't cover each job in detail, however the complexity of github action will be progressively unveiled at each new job presented.

The first job ***the building one*** doesn't use any complex mechanics of Github action. In this way it is the best one to understand the basic creating a job.

Each job is placed in the `jobs:` section of the workflow, the name is directly given through the name of the subsection after `jobs:` :

```yaml
jobs:
  build: # The section give the job name
    name: Build distribution 📦 # Displayed name
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Environment used for the job
```

The first strong point of GitHub action jobs is the free use of a set of different environment (defined through `runs-on:`)

```yaml
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: "3.x"
    - name: Install pypa/build
      run: >-
        python3 -m
        pip install
        build
        --user
    - name: Build a binary wheel and a source tarball
      run: python3 -m build
    - name: Store the distribution packages
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: python-package-distributions
        path: dist/
```
