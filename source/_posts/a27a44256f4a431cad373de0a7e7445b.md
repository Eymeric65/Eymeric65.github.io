## Code Highlight in Editable mode

When using an editable library, the Pylance code highlight can be fooled and doesn't know where to look for the different code highlight. To solve this issue if working with VsCode, you need to create a file  `.vscode/settings.json` in the root of your project and this file needs to contain the address of your editable library.

```json
{
    "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
        "../py-xl-sindy"
    ]
}

```
