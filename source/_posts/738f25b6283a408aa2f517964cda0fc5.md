Okay so I will summarize everything I have read in order to create an correct Python library.

# Name and general information

So my library is going to be for my research and will contain every function to run our version of Xl-Sindy.

## Library Name

I aim to call the library : **py-xl-sindy** it is a clear and concise name.

## Docs

I will use Sphinx heberged in Github pages in order to create a clear and widely available documentation for my library.

## Spreading

The package is aimed to be released at PyPi. It means that I need to be cautious about my releasing plan. I will follow a standard `main` `release` `develop` branch list in my git.

### Summary of git strategy

Since it is my first library, I will summarize here the framework for maintening a good git repositery.

I will work with three main branches: (instead of four in bigger project)

- **`main`:** Stable, production-ready branch.
- **`develop`:** Branch where active development happens, contains code not yet released.
- ~~**Feature branches (`feature/*`)**: Short-lived branches for specific features or fixes.~~
- **Release branches (`release/*`):** Created just before a release for final testing and version adjustments, merged back into both main and develop.

This behavior is also link with some Github action, in order to automatically push some changes to documentation (through sphinx) and push the actual library to PyPi.

### Git action

- So when I am working I am on `develop` :

```sh
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
```

I create commit like usual and I can test my library with editable mode:

```sh
pip install -e . #launched from the root directory where pyproject.toml or setup.py is located
```

***Editable** mode is pretty nice, it symlink the library with global package from the python environment (or virtual environment). It means that any change to the library code will have modification on the global python interpreter.*

- When I am done with some work I create a new `release/vX.Y.Z` branch :

```sh
git checkout -b release/vX.Y.Z
git push origin release/vX.Y.Z
```

I can finalise my work (edit my `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` version ). It is also the time where I can execute my test code (unfortunately I won't have test on this project)

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Finalize release/vX.Y.Z"
```

and finally I can merge this branch to main :

```sh
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --no-ff release/vX.Y.Z # No-ff means that git will create a commit for the merge in order to be more verbal
git push origin main
```

Now I need to do three consequent task :

- tag the `main` branch in order to trigger github action into releasing to PyPi :

```sh
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release version X.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

- merge again `release/vX.Y.Z` into `develop`:

```sh
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff release/vX.Y.Z
git push origin develop
```

- delete `release/vX.Y.Z`:

```sh
git branch -d release/vX.Y.Z
git push origin --delete release/vX.Y.Z
```

*In this paragraph I have talked about [X.Y.Z](/p/e0de890db43b4d7e87748c73fefb626d), it is nice to recall the bases of this type of versionning.*

### Github action

This differs from the last section because here we are going to talk about the script that will rub github when receiving a tag commit from the repositery. This aim at automazing the push of the library to PyPi.

In a second time Github action will also update the static Sphinx website in order to keep a fresh documentation of our library.

# Repositery folder structure

I will follow the usual path for libarry

```sh
py-xl-sindy/
├── py-xl-sindy/           # Main code folder, named after the library
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── module1.py
│   └── module2.py
├── docs/                 # Documentation files
├── tests/                # Test files
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── pyproject.toml
└── requirements.txt
```

# Requirement

So I want to publish my library has a correct PyPi library so I will need to setup a clear requirement file for pip.

Listed from my different `.py` script I will need the following :

- **Necessary :**
  - `sympy` : for symbolic expression management
  - `numpy` : for any matrix and math manipulation
  - `scipy` : for *RK45* method and *interpolation* method
  - `sklearn` : for linear regression model *Lasso*
- **Optional :**
  - `matplotlib` : for rendering of exemple (maybe not necessary)

I need to decide wether or not I need to make a double requirement for optional library or if I consider that everything is in fact necessary.

## Pyproject.toml requirement

So the `pyproject.toml` file list everything we need for development and production purpose, in addition with project description.

In the end the `pyproject.toml` dependencies listing look like this:

```toml
[project]
name = "py-xl-sindy"
requires-python = ">= 3.0"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A library for Xl-Sindy simulations"
authors = [{ name = "Eymeric Chauchat", email = "eymeric.chauchat@gmail.com" }]
license = { text = "MIT" }
readme = "README.md"
dependencies = [
"numpy>=2.1.3",
"scipy>=1.14.1",
"sympy>=1.13.3",
"scikit-learn>=1.5.2",
"matplotlib"
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest",              # For running tests
    "sphinx",              # For documentation
    "black",               # Code formatting
    "flake8",              # Linting
    "matplotlib"           # Optional plotting for examples
]
```

After this I can freely call

```sh
pip install -e .
```

# Library DocString

After some research, it should be suitable to use Google docstring in order to do the documentation of my library. Google docstring can be directly used inside Sphinx so it is really convenient to use.

## Google docstring exemple

here follows an simple exemple of google docstring applied on a class. Everything is quite explanatory so I won't get into details.

```python
"""
my_module.py 

this modules helps people to do awesome circle

"""
import math
...

class Circle:
    """A class to represent a circle.

    Attributes:
        radius (float): The radius of the circle.
    Examples:
        >>> circle = Circle(5)
        >>> circle.area()
        78.53975
    """

    def __init__(self, radius: float = 1):
        """Initialize a Circle with a given radius.

        Args:
            radius (float): The radius of the circle.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If `radius` is negative.
        """
        if radius < 0:
            raise ValueError("Radius cannot be negative.")
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self) -> float:
        """Calculate the area of the circle.

        Returns:
            float: The area of the circle.
        """
        return 3.14159 * self.radius ** 2

    def circumference(self) -> float:
        """Calculate the circumference of the circle.

        Returns:
            float: The circumference of the circle.
        """
        return 2 * 3.14159 * self.radius

```

# Sphinx the doc creator

In this section I will try to quickly explain how to create a python library documentation with the help of Sphinx.

First step is to create the base of the Sphinx documentation. After having installed the package one's need to run :

```sh
sphinx-quickstart docs\
```

After following a short tutorial to input the base variable, we need to modify `conf.py` in order to account for :

- **our working directory :** *add this*

```python
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('..'))
```

- **autodoc extension name :** *insert this*

```python
extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
    'sphinx.ext.napoleon',  # For Google and NumPy style docstrings
]
```

- *(optionnal)* **theme change :** *replace by this* (to install theme you need to install optionnal python package)

```
html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'
```

After this we can generate the autodoc file that will retrieve the different description in our python file. The process of creation of these parser file can be automated by using [apidoc](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/man/sphinx-apidoc.html) command :

```sh
sphinx-apidoc -o docs/ xlsindy/ --no-toc --separate --no-headings
```

The different tags do the following :

- **`--no-toc` :** enable little library like mine to skip the parent module file
- **`--separate` :** separate every module in their own file (better readability)
- **`--no-headings`:** doesn't provide any heading, title can be given directly by the doc string at the beginning of our file [#Google-docstring-exemple](:/content/738f25b6283a408aa2f517964cda0fc5#Google-docstring-exemple) However break the tree at the module level.
- **`--force` :** force overwrite every data made by the same command (modify every .rst file excluding index.rst)

After using this command we can generate the fixed website for debug purpose (the real one will be created using GitHub Action on GitHub Pages).

```sh
docs\make.bat clean # in order to totally erase the past build
docs\make.bat html
```

# Actual work done

So actually after 3months without having worked on this part I needed some time to become familiar again with my code. This have made me realise how precise and rigourous I will need to be for type settings and in the docstring.

I have slowly worked my way from the most basis function (actually quite hard to properly formate because of the fact that they introduce all the formalism of the biggest function)

Actually git management is not that easy at first glance ! A lot of pain to manage the first comit.
